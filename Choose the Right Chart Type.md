##Distribution

Distribution analysis is extremely useful in data analysis because it shows how your
quantitative values are distributed across their full quantitative range.

One is a box plot, and the other is a histogram. 

BOX PLOTS 

Box plots are excellent for displaying multiple distributions.
They pack all your data points—in this case, minutes per patients—into a box and whisker display (see
below). Now you can easily identify the low values, 25th-percentile values, the
medians, the 75th-percentiles, and the maximum values across all categories—all
at the same time. 


HISTOGRAM 

In a histogram we break the data out by time,
segments (or bins) and count the number of patients in each segment. 


##Part to Whole

Although pie charts are commonly used in partto-whole analysis, we suggest avoiding them.

##Geographical Data

Maps are often best when paired with another chart that details what the map displays.
