Tableau has added natural language processing to its platform with its release Ask Data, which allows users to search for – and visualise – data using natural language, rather than keywords.

The other has been dubbed Data Prep Conductor. A native integration with Tableau Server, 
it allows organisations to schedule and manage self-service data preparation at scale across the 65 different data sources 
Tableau can connect with, from Aurora to MemSQL, via Apache Drill, SAP, MongoDB, Oracle and more.


Ask Data uses algorithms to automatically profile and index data sources/queries; 
for example if someone searches their sales figures for “British furniture”
it automatically recognises that they need “product category” filtered to “furniture,” and “Country” set to “United Kingdom.” 

Ask Data as “providing a more intuitive and natural way to interact with data, lowering the barrier to entry for 
analytics and allowing people to ask questions in plain language and get highly relevant insights faster.”

It is available as part of Tableau Server and Tableau Online for no extra cost.

Tableau Data Management

Also launching alongside Tableau 2019.1 is Tableau Data Management. Being sold as a new subscription 
offering for $5.50/user per month, it includes Tableau Prep Builder for building data flows, 
and Tableau Prep Conductor for sharing flows and managing them across the organisation.


Examples:-
Demonstrated on car sales figures, the tool suggested options for users including removing spaces 
(a common error in data formatting), or numbers, or merging terms with similar spelling and/or 
different uses of uppercase and lowercase. 
(e.g. Merging Honda and hondaa; march2019 and Mar19)



Prep Conductor also provides increased visibility into the health of data sources, 
allowing users to set status reports and even proactive alerts,
e.g. if sales or returns go above a certain threshold in a certain geography.
