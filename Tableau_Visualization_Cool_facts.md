## Trends over Time:

Some of the best visualizations for showing trends over time are line charts, area charts, and bar charts. In addition,
you should try to put time on the X-axis and the measure on the Y-axis.


 ## Area Charts or Bar Charts: 
 
 
 Both of these chart types are great at amplifying total funding 
trends over time and how each individual sector contributes to the total over time.
However, they do have a distinct difference: The area chart treats each sector as
a single pattern while the bar chart focuses on each year as a single pattern. 


## Comparison and Ranking

A bar chart is great for comparison and ranking because it encodes
quantitative values as length on the same baseline, making it extremely easy to
compare values. 


## Correlation

Running a simple correlation analysis is a great place to start in identifying relationships
between measures. Be mindful that correlation doesn’t guarantee a relationship.


## Distribution
Distribution analysis is extremely useful in data analysis because it shows how your quantitative values are distributed across their full quantitative range.

One is a box plot, and the other is a histogram.

_BOX PLOTS_

Box plots are excellent for displaying multiple distributions. They pack all your data points—in this case, minutes per patients—into a box and whisker display (see below). Now you can easily identify the low values, 25th-percentile values, the medians, the 75th-percentiles, and the maximum values across all categories—all at the same time.

_HISTOGRAM_

In a histogram we break the data out by time, segments (or bins) and count the number of patients in each segment.

## Part to Whole
Although pie charts are commonly used in partto-whole analysis, we suggest avoiding them.

## Geographical Data
Maps are often best when paired with another chart that details what the map displays.
