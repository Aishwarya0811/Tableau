Trends over Time:

Some of the best visualizations for showing trends over time are line charts, area charts, and bar charts. In addition,
you should try to put time on the X-axis and the measure on the Y-axis.


 Area Charts or Bar Charts: 
 
 
 Both of these chart types are great at amplifying total funding 
trends over time and how each individual sector contributes to the total over time.
However, they do have a distinct difference: The area chart treats each sector as
a single pattern while the bar chart focuses on each year as a single pattern. 


Comparison and Ranking

A bar chart is great for comparison and ranking because it encodes
quantitative values as length on the same baseline, making it extremely easy to
compare values. 


Correlation

Running a simple correlation analysis is a great place to start in identifying relationships
between measures. Be mindful that correlation doesnâ€™t guarantee a relationship.
